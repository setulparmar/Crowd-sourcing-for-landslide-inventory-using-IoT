# Landslide Detection and Prediction


# Crawler Engine

**Designed JSON config file to manage API calls** and build crawler engine to crowdsource landslide related events in india from youtube and twitter. Further divided crawler engine to do general and focused crawling.

# Filtering and Pre-Processing

Preprocessed data using NLP techniques and filtered out irrelevant events using hard-coding.

# Data Analysis

Implemented Word Embedding using huggingface Sentence Transformer model and then used unsupervised approach to visualise cluster similar events together.

# Ranking Important Keywords

Ranked Important Keywords using YAKE library which helped us to do more focused research on bigger landslide events.

# Location Extraction

Improved time complexity of Location Extraction by one-third by implementing advanced and scalable trie data structure using APIs from Pygtrie library.

# Prediction Model


Note : Daily automatic collection and filtering was there with the help of scheduling in deepnote.com .
